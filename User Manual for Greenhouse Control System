Download The proteus source File given my repository GHC7.pdsprj
open it in the Proteus Software, then download Sensor Libraries Given in the repository - Proteus Sensor Libraies 
paste that files at the location- C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY in your system
as soon as you open the GHC7.pdsprj in proteus software , double click on each sensor go to the above location add the hex file of that particular sensor 
then you are good to go....
I am also attaching Proteus 8 Professional Cracked version in this repo


User Manual for Greenhouse Control System

Introduction:
The Greenhouse Control System is designed to monitor and control environmental conditions within a greenhouse to optimize plant growth and health. This user manual provides instructions for setting up, operating, and maintaining the system.

1. System Overview:
The Greenhouse Control System comprises the following components:

Microcontroller (8051)
Sensors:
Temperature Sensor
Gas (Methane) Sensor
Moisture Sensor
Actuators:
Motor (for ventilation)
Exhaust Fan
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) for displaying readings and system status

2. Setup:
Follow these steps to set up the Greenhouse Control System:

Connect the sensors to the designated analog input pins of the microcontroller.
Connect the motor and exhaust fan to the specified output pins of the microcontroller.
Connect the LCD to the microcontroller for displaying readings and system status.
Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated.
Power up the system using a suitable power source.


3. Operation:
Operating the Greenhouse Control System involves the following steps:

The LCD displays real-time readings of temperature, gas (methane) level, moisture, and system statuses.
The system continuously monitors environmental parameters to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.
Based on the sensor readings, the system controls the motor and exhaust fan as follows:
If temperature and moisture levels are low, the motor is activated to provide ventilation.
If moisture levels are high, the motor is stopped to prevent excessive humidity.
If temperature is high and moisture is low, the motor is activated for airflow.
If both temperature and moisture levels are high, the motor is stopped to prevent overheating.
Gas detection activates the exhaust fan if methane levels exceed the predefined threshold.
Users can monitor the system's operation and conditions through the LCD display.
